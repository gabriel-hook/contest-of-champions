While in the Reflective state, his suit cannot trigger Armor Up.\n For every 300 damage stored, Black Panther gains a Reflect charge. When successfully hitting the opponent, Black Panther consumes all charges to deal the equivalent damage back to the opponent. Charges lasts for 7 seconds.\n\nWhen Stunned\n Black Panther’s Vibranium Armor consumes an Armor Up effect to reflect physical Stun effects back to enemies. 100% chance to Stun opponents for 2 seconds."
